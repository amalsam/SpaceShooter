# SpaceShooter AI with NEAT Neural Network

### Overview
This repository contains the code for training an AI to play a space shooter game using the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) neural network library in Python. The project aims to showcase the capabilities of NEAT in evolving neural networks to perform complex tasks, such as navigating and scoring in a spaceshooter game.

### Requirements
Python 3.x
NEAT library ''' pip install neat-python '''
'''pip install pygame'''

### Getting Started
Clone the repository:

''' git clone --branch training-AI https://github.com/amalsam/SpaceShooter.git '''
'''cd SpaceShooter'''

### Run the training script:

python spaceshooter.py

### Configuration
Adjust the parameters in the config-feedforward.txt file to fine-tune the NEAT algorithm and the game environment for optimal performance.
